# Test

## Unit Testing

Unit tests will be implemented to test the behaviour of the functions. Testing every function brings security when reusing previous functions. Through unit testing, we have a likely guarantee that the helper functions we are using work correctly. Some unit tests will be made that test specific regular use case values. Additionally, some unit tests will use edge cases as parameters to check correctness.

## UI Testing

UI tests will be done manually. While unit tests excel with testing data and predictable behaviour, UI is often better to test with using the application. During UI tests, functions are assumed to work correctly through unit testing. UI tests will be conducted to ensure that the application will work in a Chrome browser.

## Responsibility

The programmer for the function will be responsible for creating unit tests. The team will get together at the beginning of the project for a training session on how to implement unit tests with the Javascript test framework, Mocha.
